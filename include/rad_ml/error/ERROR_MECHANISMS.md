# Error Handling Mechanisms in Radiation-Tolerant Computing

## Scientific and Technical Overview

The `rad_ml/error` module provides a robust, extensible framework for error detection, classification, propagation, and recovery in radiation-tolerant machine learning and control systems. It is designed to support high-reliability operation in extreme environments, where both transient and persistent faults are common.

## 1. Error Abstraction and Classification — `error_handling.hpp`

**Scientific Rationale:**
Radiation environments induce a wide variety of faults, from single-event upsets to persistent hardware failures. A structured error handling system is essential for distinguishing between error types, assessing severity, and enabling appropriate mitigation or recovery actions.

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Source Location Tracking:**
  - Custom `SourceLocation` struct (C++17 compatible) records file, line, and function for every error, supporting traceability and root-cause analysis.
- **Error Severity and Category:**
  - Enumerations for severity (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`, `FATAL`) and category (e.g., `MEMORY`, `RADIATION`, `TMR`, `NEURAL_NETWORK`, etc.) enable fine-grained filtering and response.
- **Error Codes:**
  - Standardized error codes (e.g., `SUCCESS`, `OUT_OF_MEMORY`, `RADIATION_ERROR`, `INVALID_ARGUMENT`) facilitate programmatic handling and reporting.
- **Structured Error Information:**
  - The `ErrorInfo` struct encapsulates all error metadata, including code, category, severity, message, source location, and optional details.

## 2. Exception and Result Handling

**Mathematical/Algorithmic Aspects:**
- **Exception Propagation:**
  - `RadiationFrameworkException` extends `std::exception` and carries full `ErrorInfo`, supporting both catchable and fatal error handling.
- **Monadic Result Type:**
  - The `Result<T>` template class models computations that may fail, encapsulating either a value of type `T` or an `ErrorInfo`. This is mathematically analogous to the `Either` or `Option` monad in functional programming:
    \[
    \text{Result}(T) = T \;|\; \text{ErrorInfo}
    \]
  - Provides methods for mapping, chaining, and extracting results, supporting composable error-aware computation.

## 3. Logging, Reporting, and Callbacks

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Error Logging:**
  - Abstract `IErrorLogger` interface and concrete `ConsoleErrorLogger` for flexible logging backends.
  - Centralized `ErrorHandler` manages logging, reporting level, and error callbacks.
- **Callback Registration:**
  - Allows registration of custom error handling callbacks for integration with telemetry, alerting, or recovery systems.
- **Thread Safety:**
  - All logging and callback operations are thread-safe, supporting concurrent and real-time systems.

## 4. Framework Integration: How `rad_ml` Uses Error Handling

The error handling system is deeply integrated into the `rad_ml` framework, enabling:

- **Propagation:**
  - All core modules (memory, redundancy, neural, mission, physics) use `Result<T>` and `ErrorInfo` for error propagation, ensuring that faults are never silently ignored.
- **Classification and Filtering:**
  - Errors are classified by severity and category, allowing the system to escalate, log, or recover as appropriate.
- **Adaptive Response:**
  - The framework can dynamically adjust protection strategies, trigger recovery routines, or escalate to mission control based on error patterns and severity.
- **Telemetry and Diagnostics:**
  - Error logs and callbacks feed into telemetry systems for in-mission diagnostics and post-mission analysis.

**Example Usage Flow:**
1. **Error Occurrence:** A fault (e.g., memory upset, computation error) is detected and encapsulated in an `ErrorInfo`.
2. **Propagation:** The error is returned via a `Result<T>` or thrown as a `RadiationFrameworkException`.
3. **Logging/Callback:** The error is logged and/or triggers registered callbacks.
4. **System Response:** Depending on severity and category, the system may retry, escalate, reconfigure, or enter a safe state.

## Scientific Impact and Integration

A rigorous error handling framework is essential for high-reliability, safety-critical systems in radiation environments. By providing structured error metadata, composable result types, and flexible logging/callback mechanisms, the `rad_ml/error` module enables:

- Predictive and adaptive fault management.
- Seamless integration with redundancy, memory, neural, and mission modules.
- Enhanced traceability, diagnostics, and post-mission analysis.
