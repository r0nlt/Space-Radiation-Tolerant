# Mission Profile Mechanisms for Radiation-Tolerant Computing

## Scientific and Technical Overview

The `rad_ml/mission` module provides a configurable, extensible framework for modeling, simulating, and optimizing space mission profiles with respect to radiation-tolerant computing. It encapsulates the interplay between environmental hazards, hardware/software constraints, and adaptive protection strategies, enabling mission-aware configuration and risk mitigation for AI and control systems in space.

## 1. Mission Profile Abstraction — `mission_profile.hpp`

**Scientific Rationale:**
Space missions encounter vastly different radiation environments, hardware capabilities, and operational constraints. A mission profile abstraction enables the systematic mapping of these factors to optimal protection, resource allocation, and telemetry strategies.

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Mission Types:** Enumerates canonical mission scenarios (LEO, GEO, Lunar, Mars, Deep Space, etc.), each with distinct environmental and operational parameters.
- **Radiation Environment Modeling:**
  - Encapsulates annual dose, peak flux, SAA (South Atlantic Anomaly) likelihood, solar event sensitivity, and galactic cosmic ray exposure.
  - These parameters inform the selection of error correction, scrubbing, and redundancy strategies.
- **Hardware Configuration:**
  - Models processor type, process node, ECC/TMR availability, compute/memory/power budgets.
  - Enables hardware-aware adaptation of ML models and protection mechanisms.
- **Software Configuration:**
  - Controls scrubbing intervals, checkpointing, redundancy levels, fallback/quantized models, and recovery modes.
  - Supports dynamic adaptation to mission phase and fault statistics.
- **Telemetry Configuration:**
  - Manages logging, error reporting, and data retention for in-mission diagnostics and post-mission analysis.

**Mathematical/Algorithmic Aspects:**
- **Environment-to-Protection Mapping:**
  - The mission profile selects an initial protection level (e.g., ECC, TMR, adaptive) based on environmental risk, using a mapping:
    \[
    \text{ProtectionLevel} = f(\text{MissionType}, \text{RadiationEnvironment}, \text{HardwareConfig})
    \]
- **Simulation Integration:**
  - Provides interfaces to radiation simulators, enabling Monte Carlo or deterministic evaluation of mission scenarios.
- **Network Configuration:**
  - Template methods allow direct configuration of neural networks or control systems according to mission-specific constraints and priorities.

**Relevance:**
- **Mission-Aware Adaptation:**
  - Ensures that AI/control systems are optimally protected and resource-allocated for the specific mission context.
- **Risk Mitigation:**
  - Facilitates proactive planning for solar events, SAA crossings, and deep space hazards.
- **Operational Efficiency:**
  - Balances reliability, performance, and resource usage through mission-tailored configuration.

## 2. Framework Integration: How `rad_ml` Uses Mission Profiles

The mission profile system is deeply integrated into the overall `rad_ml` framework, enabling mission-aware adaptation and configuration at every layer:

- **Initialization:**
  - At system startup, a `MissionProfile` object is instantiated based on mission type or name (e.g., "LEO", "MARS_SURFACE").
- **Configuration Propagation:**
  - The mission profile provides environment, hardware, software, and telemetry parameters to all core modules:
    - **Redundancy and Memory:** Sets scrubbing intervals, ECC/TMR levels, and checkpointing based on mission risk.
    - **Neural Network Protection:** Configures protection levels, quantization, and fallback models for neural nets.
    - **Simulation and Testing:** Supplies environment parameters to radiation simulators for scenario evaluation.
    - **Telemetry:** Directs logging, error reporting, and retention policies for mission-specific diagnostics.
- **Adaptive Protection:**
  - The framework queries the mission profile to dynamically adjust protection strategies in response to environmental changes (e.g., solar storms, SAA crossings) or system health metrics.
- **Resource Management:**
  - Hardware and power constraints from the mission profile inform model selection, memory allocation, and compute scheduling.
- **Mission-Aware Fine-Tuning:**
  - Training and fine-tuning routines use mission profile data to optimize neural network robustness for the expected environment.

**Example Usage Flow:**
1. **Mission Selection:** User or system selects a mission type (e.g., `MissionProfile::MARS_SURFACE`).
2. **Profile Instantiation:** `MissionProfile` is constructed, initializing all relevant parameters.
3. **System Configuration:** Core modules (redundancy, memory, neural, telemetry) query the profile for their settings.
4. **Runtime Adaptation:** During operation, the system monitors environment and health, using the profile to adapt protection and resource strategies as needed.

## Scientific Impact and Integration

The mission profile mechanism is a cornerstone for deploying robust, adaptive AI and control systems in space. By formalizing the relationship between mission context, environmental risk, and system configuration, it enables:
- Predictive risk assessment and mitigation.
- Automated adaptation of protection and resource strategies.
- Seamless integration with simulation, telemetry, and hardware/software co-design.
