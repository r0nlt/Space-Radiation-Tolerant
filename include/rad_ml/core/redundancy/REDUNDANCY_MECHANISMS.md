# Redundancy Mechanisms in Radiation-Tolerant Computing

## Scientific and Technical Overview

The `rad_ml/core/redundancy` module implements a comprehensive suite of redundancy mechanisms designed to ensure the integrity and reliability of machine learning and control systems operating in radiation-prone environments, such as space. These mechanisms are grounded in both classical fault-tolerance theory and recent advances in adaptive error correction, providing robust protection against a wide spectrum of radiation-induced faults.

## 1. Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) — `tmr.hpp`

**Scientific Rationale:**
Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) is a foundational technique in fault-tolerant computing, providing resilience against single-event upsets (SEUs) by maintaining three independent copies of critical data or computation. Majority voting is used to mask single faults, ensuring correct operation as long as no more than one copy is corrupted.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Stores three copies of a value in an array.
- On read, performs majority voting; if two or more copies agree, that value is returned.
- On write, all three copies are updated.
- If no majority exists, the first value is returned (with the expectation that higher-level logic will handle this rare case).

**Relevance:**
TMR is lightweight and effective for SEU protection, making it suitable for general use in radiation environments.

## 2. Enhanced Triple Modular Redundancy — `enhanced_tmr.hpp`

**Scientific Rationale:**
While classic TMR is effective for single-bit errors, it is insufficient for more complex or clustered faults (e.g., multiple-cell upsets, burst errors). Enhanced TMR augments the basic scheme with error detection, correction, and statistical monitoring, enabling recovery from a broader range of fault patterns.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Each copy is protected by a CRC32 checksum, enabling detection of silent data corruption.
- Advanced voting strategies are employed, including bit-level, word-level, and burst error voting.
- The system analyzes disagreement patterns to select the most appropriate correction strategy (adaptive voting).
- Automatic repair: corrupted copies are overwritten with the corrected value and checksums are recalculated.
- Tracks error statistics: detected, corrected, and uncorrectable errors.

**Relevance:**
Enhanced TMR is suitable for critical data and computations where silent or complex errors must be detected and corrected, not just masked.

## 3. Enhanced Voting Mechanisms — `enhanced_voting.hpp`

**Scientific Rationale:**
Radiation environments can induce a variety of error patterns, including single-bit, adjacent-bit, byte-level, word-level, and burst errors. Simple majority voting is not always sufficient. Enhanced voting algorithms are designed to address these diverse patterns, maximizing the probability of correct recovery.

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Bit-Level Voting:** Recovers from single-bit and adjacent-bit errors by voting on each bit position.
- **Word/Burst Error Voting:** Uses Hamming distance and segment-based voting to correct errors affecting entire words or clusters of bits.
- **Adaptive Voting:** Selects the optimal voting strategy based on real-time analysis of the observed error pattern.
- **Weighted Voting:** Allows for reliability weighting of each copy, useful if some hardware is more trustworthy.
- **Fault Pattern Detection:** Analyzes differences between copies to classify the likely error type, enabling targeted correction.

**Relevance:**
These algorithms are essential for robust error correction in environments where error patterns are unpredictable and may not be limited to single-bit upsets.

## 4. Space-Flight Optimized Enhanced TMR — `space_enhanced_tmr.hpp`

**Scientific Rationale:**
Space-flight and embedded systems require not only robust error correction but also deterministic execution and explicit error reporting. This implementation is tailored for real-time, safety-critical applications.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses fixed memory allocation and unrolled loops for predictable timing.
- Returns explicit status codes (e.g., `SUCCESS`, `REDUNDANCY_FAILURE`, `RADIATION_DETECTION`) for integration with mission control and fault management systems.
- Specialized CRC and voting logic, including floating-point aware voting for scientific data.
- Maintains detailed error counters for mission health reporting.

**Relevance:**
Ideal for flight software, on-board computers, and any system where deterministic behavior and explicit error reporting are required.

## 5. Scientific Impact and Integration

The redundancy mechanisms in this module are designed to be layered and adaptive, providing protection at multiple levels (from individual variables to entire data structures). By combining classic and enhanced TMR, advanced voting algorithms, and space-optimized implementations, the framework ensures robust, autonomous operation of machine learning and control systems in the most challenging environments.
