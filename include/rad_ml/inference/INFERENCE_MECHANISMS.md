# Inference Mechanisms for Radiation-Tolerant Neural Networks

## Scientific and Technical Overview

The `rad_ml/inference` module provides the core abstractions and mechanisms for performing reliable, radiation-tolerant inference with neural network models in extreme environments. It is designed to ensure that inference remains robust in the presence of transient and persistent faults, leveraging both algorithmic and architectural resilience.

## 1. Radiation-Tolerant Model Abstraction â€” `model.hpp`

**Scientific Rationale:**
In radiation-prone environments, neural network models are susceptible to bit flips, parameter corruption, and other faults that can compromise inference accuracy and system safety. A dedicated abstraction for radiation-tolerant models enables systematic implementation of error detection, correction, and health monitoring.

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Abstract Interface:**
  - `RadiationTolerantModel` is an abstract base class that all radiation-tolerant models must implement.
  - Defines a standard interface for:
    - `runInference`: Executes a forward pass on input data, returning output in a fault-aware manner.
    - `repair`: Repairs or corrects any detected faults in the model's parameters or state.
    - `isHealthy`: Checks the health status of the model, enabling runtime monitoring and adaptive response.
- **Automatic Memory Scrubbing:**
  - Integrates with the `MemoryScrubber` from the memory module.
  - Provides `enableAutoScrubbing` and `disableAutoScrubbing` methods to periodically check and repair the model's memory regions.
  - Scrubbing interval is configurable, supporting mission- or environment-specific adaptation.
- **Extensibility:**
  - Designed for extension by concrete model classes, including support for custom layers and architectures (see the `layers/` subdirectory).

## 2. Framework Integration: How `rad_ml` Uses Inference Mechanisms

The inference system is tightly integrated into the overall `rad_ml` framework:

- **Deployment:**
  - All deployed neural network models in the system inherit from `RadiationTolerantModel`, ensuring a uniform interface for inference, repair, and health checks.
- **Fault Detection and Recovery:**
  - During operation, models can be automatically scrubbed and repaired, minimizing the risk of silent data corruption.
  - Health checks can trigger system-level responses, such as model retraining, fallback, or mission reconfiguration.
- **Mission-Aware Adaptation:**
  - Scrubbing intervals and repair strategies can be tuned based on mission profile, environmental risk, and system health metrics.
- **Layered Protection:**
  - The design supports integration with protected layers and advanced error correction mechanisms, further enhancing inference reliability.

**Example Usage Flow:**
1. **Model Initialization:** A model derived from `RadiationTolerantModel` is instantiated and deployed.
2. **Inference:** The system calls `runInference` for predictions, with built-in error awareness.
3. **Health Monitoring:** The system periodically checks `isHealthy` and, if needed, calls `repair` or triggers scrubbing.
4. **Adaptive Response:** If faults are detected, the system can escalate, reconfigure, or switch to backup models.

## Scientific Impact and Integration

The inference mechanisms in this module are essential for deploying neural networks in safety-critical, radiation-prone environments. By providing a unified, extensible interface for inference, repair, and health monitoring, the framework enables:

- Predictive and adaptive fault management during inference.
- Seamless integration with memory protection, redundancy, and mission-aware adaptation.
- Enhanced reliability and safety for AI-driven systems in space and other extreme domains.
