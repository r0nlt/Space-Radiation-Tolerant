# Radiation Environment Module â€” `rad_ml/radiation/`

---

## Overview

The `rad_ml/radiation/` directory provides the core abstractions and simulation tools for modeling, configuring, and simulating radiation environments and their effects on electronic systems. It is foundational for enabling realistic, mission-specific, and scientifically accurate studies of radiation-induced errors in the rad_ml framework.

> This module enables the definition of space environments, simulation of single event upsets (SEUs), and construction of complex mission profiles for robust, radiation-aware AI and system design.

## File-by-File Analysis

### [`environment.hpp`](environment.hpp)
- **Purpose:**
  Defines the `Environment` class and `EnvironmentType` enum for representing and configuring radiation environments (e.g., LEO, GEO, Mars, Jupiter, Solar Flare, Custom).
- **Key Features:**
  - Predefined and custom environments with default SEU flux and cross-section values.
  - Methods to set/get SEU flux, cross-section, and arbitrary properties.
  - Factory method for creating standard environments.
- **Role:**
  Provides a flexible, extensible abstraction for radiation conditions, used throughout the framework for simulation, protection, and mission modeling.

### [`seu_simulator.hpp`](seu_simulator.hpp)
- **Purpose:**
  Implements the `SEUSimulator` class for simulating single event upsets (bit flips) in memory regions due to radiation.
- **Key Features:**
  - Configurable by environment and random seed.
  - Injects bit flips into memory based on SEU flux, cross-section, memory size, and exposure duration.
  - Uses Poisson statistics for realistic SEU event modeling.
  - Supports batch simulation across multiple memory regions with callback support.
- **Role:**
  Enables realistic, statistically accurate simulation of radiation-induced memory errors for testing, validation, and research.

### [`space_mission.hpp`](space_mission.hpp)
- **Purpose:**
  Provides abstractions for modeling complex space missions, including mission phases, targets, and time-varying environments.
- **Key Features:**
  - `MissionPhaseType` and `MissionTarget` enums for standardizing mission scenarios.
  - `MissionPhase` struct for associating environment, duration, and shielding with each phase.
  - `SpaceMission` class for building mission profiles, querying environment at a given time, and calculating total radiation exposure.
  - Factory methods for standard missions (LEO, GEO, Mars, Jupiter, etc.).
- **Role:**
  Supports end-to-end mission simulation, allowing the framework to model how radiation exposure changes over time and mission context.
