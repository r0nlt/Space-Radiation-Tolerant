# SpaceLabs AI Onboarding Guide

**Welcome to SpaceLabs AI!**

This document will help you understand our flagship product: the Radiation-Tolerant Machine Learning Framework. Whether you're a software engineer, data scientist, or space systems specialist, this guide will give you the foundation to contribute to our mission of enabling reliable AI in space environments.

## Company Overview

**SpaceLabs AI** specializes in developing software solutions that enable AI and machine learning systems to operate reliably in harsh radiation environments, particularly in space. Our core technology is a radiation-hardened framework that protects neural networks and other ML algorithms from radiation-induced errors.

## Framework Overview

The Radiation-Tolerant ML Framework is a C++ library that implements industry-standard radiation tolerance techniques validated against NASA and ESA reference models. Our breakthrough technology demonstrates that properly designed neural networks can maintain and even enhance performance under radiation conditions.

### Core Components

1. **Protection Libraries**
   - `rad_ml_tmr`: Triple Modular Redundancy implementation
   - `rad_ml_qft`: Quantum Field Theory models for radiation effects
   - `rad_ml_testing`: Testing and fault injection framework
   - `rad_ml_sensors`: Sensor data handling with radiation protection
   - `rad_ml_simulation`: Simulation environments for space radiation

2. **Key Features**
   - Error detection and correction specific to ML operations
   - Radiation environment simulation (LEO, GEO, Mars, Jupiter)
   - NASA/ESA standard compliance
   - Adaptive protection based on radiation intensity
   - Python bindings for integration with ML workflows

## Getting Started

### Building the Framework

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   ./tools/install_dependencies.sh
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   ./tools/build_all.sh
   ```

3. Run tests to verify your setup:
   ```bash
   ./tools/run_tests.sh
   ```

### Hello World Example

Here's a simple example showing how to protect an ML operation:

```cpp
#include "rad_ml/api/protection.hpp"
#include "rad_ml/sim/mission_environment.hpp"

using namespace rad_ml;

int main() {
    // Initialize protection with material properties
    core::MaterialProperties aluminum;
    aluminum.radiation_tolerance = 50.0; // Standard aluminum
    tmr::PhysicsDrivenProtection protection(aluminum);
    
    // Configure for your target environment (e.g., Low Earth Orbit)
    sim::RadiationEnvironment env = sim::createEnvironment(sim::Environment::LEO);
    protection.updateEnvironment(env);
    
    // Define a simple ML operation
    auto ml_operation = []() {
        // Your ML model inference code here
        float result = 0.75f; // Example output
        return result;
    };
    
    // Execute with radiation protection
    auto result = protection.executeProtected<float>(ml_operation);
    
    // Check for detected errors
    if (result.error_detected) {
        std::cout << "Error detected and " 
                  << (result.error_corrected ? "corrected!" : "not corrected")
                  << std::endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Key Concepts

### Radiation Effects on Computing

When high-energy particles from space radiation strike semiconductor materials:

- **Single Event Upset (SEU)**: Bit flips in memory
- **Multiple Bit Upset (MBU)**: Multiple bits flipped from a single strike
- **Single Event Functional Interrupt (SEFI)**: Disruption requiring reset
- **Single Event Latch-up (SEL)**: Potentially destructive low-resistance path

Our framework addresses these issues through software-based protection mechanisms.

### Protection Techniques

1. **Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR)**
   - Replicates computations three times and uses voting to detect/correct errors

2. **Error Correction Codes**
   - Advanced Reed-Solomon codes for protecting neural network weights

3. **Adaptive Protection**
   - Dynamically adjusts protection level based on the radiation environment

4. **Quantum Field Theory Models**
   - Uses advanced physics to predict and mitigate radiation effects

## Common Workflows

### 1. Protecting a Neural Network

```cpp
#include "rad_ml/neural/adaptive_protection.hpp"

// Create adaptive protection
neural::AdaptiveProtection protection;

// Configure for desired environment
protection.setRadiationEnvironment(sim::createEnvironment(sim::Environment::MARS));
protection.setBaseProtectionLevel(neural::ProtectionLevel::MODERATE);

// Protect a neural network weight matrix
std::vector<float> weights = /* your neural network weights */;
auto protected_weights = protection.protectValue(weights);

// Later, recover the weights (with automatic error correction)
auto recovered_weights = protection.recoverValue(protected_weights);
```

### 2. Running a Mission Simulation

The mission simulator provides a way to test how ML models perform in different space environments:

```bash
./examples/mission_simulator/mission_simulator
```

### 3. Using Python Bindings

```python
import rad_ml

# Create a protection object
protection = rad_ml.AdaptiveProtection()

# Set environment
protection.set_environment(rad_ml.Environment.LEO)

# Protect a numpy array of neural network weights
weights = np.array([...])  # Your weights
protected = protection.protect_array(weights)

# Use in inference and recover later
recovered = protection.recover_array(protected)
```

## Validation and Testing

### Testing Your Changes

1. Unit tests:
   ```bash
   ./tools/run_tests.sh framework_verification_test
   ```

2. Radiation simulation tests:
   ```bash
   ./tools/run_tests.sh radiation_stress_test
   ```

3. Full test suite:
   ```bash
   ./tools/run_tests.sh
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Always Validate in Multiple Environments**
   - Test in LEO, GEO, MARS, and high-radiation scenarios

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Higher protection levels have computational costs
   - Use adaptive protection to balance reliability and performance

3. **Memory Management**
   - Protected memory requires additional space for redundancy
   - Consider space/protection tradeoffs for embedded systems

4. **Error Handling**
   - Always check error detection flags
   - Log corrected vs. uncorrected errors
