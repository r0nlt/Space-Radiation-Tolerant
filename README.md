## How Radiation Affects Computing

High-energy particles from space radiation strike semiconductor materials in computing hardware, they can cause several types of errors:

- **Single Event Upset (SEU)**: A change in state caused by one ionizing particle striking a sensitive node in a microelectronic device
- **Multiple Bit Upset (MBU)**: Multiple bits flipped from a single particle strike
- **Single Event Functional Interrupt (SEFI)**: A disruption of normal operations (typically requiring a reset)
- **Single Event Latch-up (SEL)**: A potentially destructive condition involving parasitic circuit elements creating a low-resistance path

These effects can corrupt data in memory, alter computational results, or even permanently damage hardware. In space environments where maintenance is impossible, radiation tolerance becomes critical for mission success.

Space-Radiation-Tolerant addresses these challenges through software-based protection mechanisms that detect and correct radiation-induced errors, allowing ML systems to operate reliably even in harsh radiation environments. The software framework is intended to work alongside hardware protection strategies to achieve enhanced protection through hybrid protection methods.

## Quick Start Guide

Here's how to use the framework to protect a simple ML inference operation:

```cpp
#include "rad_ml/api/protection.hpp"
#include "rad_ml/sim/mission_environment.hpp"

using namespace rad_ml;

int main() {
    // 1. Initialize protection with material properties
    core::MaterialProperties aluminum;
    aluminum.radiation_tolerance = 50.0; // Standard aluminum
    tmr::PhysicsDrivenProtection protection(aluminum);

    // 2. Configure for your target environment
    sim::RadiationEnvironment env = sim::createEnvironment(sim::Environment::LEO);
    protection.updateEnvironment(env);

    // 3. Define your ML inference operation
    auto my_ml_operation = []() {
        // Your ML model inference code here
        float result = 0.0f; // Replace with actual inference
        return result;
    };

    // 4. Execute with radiation protection
    auto result = protection.executeProtected<float>(my_ml_operation);

    // 5. Check for detected errors
    if (result.error_detected) {
        std::cout << "Error detected and "
                  << (result.error_corrected ? "corrected!" : "not corrected")
                  << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Using Advanced Reed-Solomon Error Correction

```cpp
#include "rad_ml/neural/advanced_reed_solomon.hpp"

// Create Reed-Solomon codec with 8-bit symbols, 12 total symbols, 8 data symbols
neural::AdvancedReedSolomon<uint8_t, 8> rs_codec(12, 8);

// Encode a vector of data
std::vector<uint8_t> data = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
auto encoded = rs_codec.encode(data);

// Simulate error (corrupt some data)
encoded[2] = 255;  // Corrupt a symbol

// Decode with error correction
auto decoded = rs_codec.decode(encoded);
if (decoded) {
    std::cout << "Successfully recovered data" << std::endl;
}
```

### Using Adaptive Protection Strategy

```cpp
#include "rad_ml/neural/adaptive_protection.hpp"

// Create adaptive protection with default settings
neural::AdaptiveProtection protection;

// Configure for current environment
protection.setRadiationEnvironment(sim::createEnvironment(sim::Environment::MARS));
protection.setBaseProtectionLevel(neural::ProtectionLevel::MODERATE);

// Protect a neural network weight matrix
std::vector<float> weights = /* your neural network weights */;
auto protected_weights = protection.protectValue(weights);

// Later, recover the weights (with automatic error correction)
auto recovered_weights = protection.recoverValue(protected_weights);

// Check protection statistics
auto stats = protection.getProtectionStats();
std::cout << "Errors detected: " << stats.errors_detected << std::endl;
std::cout << "Errors corrected: " << stats.errors_corrected << std::endl;
```

## Common API Usage Examples

### Protecting a Simple Calculation

```cpp
// Define a simple function to protect
auto calculation = [](float x, float y) -> float {
    return x * y + std::sqrt(x) / y;  // Could have radiation-induced errors
};

// Protect it against radiation effects
float result = protection.executeProtected<float>([&]() {
    return calculation(3.14f, 2.71f);
}).value;
```

### Protecting Neural Network Inference

```cpp
// Protect a neural network forward pass
auto protected_inference = [&](const std::vector<float>& input) -> std::vector<float> {
    // Create a wrapper for your neural network inference
    return protection.executeProtected<std::vector<float>>([&]() {
        return neural_network.forward(input);
    }).value;
};

// Use the protected inference function
std::vector<float> output = protected_inference(input_data);
```

### Configuring Environment-Specific Protection

```cpp
// Configure for LEO (Low Earth Orbit) environment
sim::RadiationEnvironment leo = sim::createEnvironment(sim::Environment::LEO);
protection.updateEnvironment(leo);

// Perform protected operations in LEO environment
// ...

// Configure for SAA crossing (South Atlantic Anomaly)
sim::RadiationEnvironment saa = sim::createEnvironment(sim::Environment::SAA);
protection.updateEnvironment(saa);
protection.enterMissionPhase(MissionPhase::SAA_CROSSING);

// Perform protected operations with enhanced protection for SAA
// ...
```

### Handling Detected Errors

```cpp
// Execute with error detection
auto result = protection.executeProtected<float>([&]() {
    return performComputation();
});

// Check if errors were detected and corrected
if (result.error_detected) {
    if (result.error_corrected) {
        logger.info("Error detected and corrected");
    } else {
        logger.warning("Error detected but could not be corrected");
        fallbackStrategy();
    }
}
```

### Using the Enhanced Mission Simulator (v0.9.6)

```cpp
#include "rad_ml/testing/mission_simulator.hpp"
#include "rad_ml/tmr/enhanced_tmr.hpp"

using namespace rad_ml::testing;
using namespace rad_ml::tmr;

int main() {
    // Create a mission profile for Low Earth Orbit
    MissionProfile profile = MissionProfile::createStandard("LEO");

    // Configure adaptive protection
    AdaptiveProtectionConfig protection_config;
    protection_config.enable_tmr_medium = true;
    protection_config.memory_scrubbing_interval_ms = 5000;

    // Create mission simulator
    MissionSimulator simulator(profile, protection_config);

    // Create your neural network
    YourNeuralNetwork network;

    // Register important memory regions for radiation simulation
    simulator.registerMemoryRegion(network.getWeightsPtr(),
                                 network.getWeightsSize(),
                                 true);  // Enable protection

    // Run the simulation for 30 mission seconds
    auto stats = simulator.runSimulation(
        std::chrono::seconds(30),
        std::chrono::seconds(3),
        [&network](const RadiationEnvironment& env) {
            // Adapt protection based on environment
            if (env.inside_saa || env.solar_activity > 5.0) {
                network.increaseProtectionLevel();
            } else {
                network.useStandardProtection();
            }
        }
    );

    // Print mission statistics
    std::cout << stats.getReport() << std::endl;

    // Test neural network after the mission
    network.runInference(test_data);

    return 0;
}
```

## Python Bindings Usage (v0.9.5)

As of v0.9.5, the framework now provides Python bindings for key radiation protection features, making the technology more accessible to data scientists and machine learning practitioners.

### Basic Usage with TMR Protection

```python
import rad_ml_minimal as rad_ml
from rad_ml_minimal.rad_ml.tmr import StandardTMR

# Initialize the framework
rad_ml.initialize()

# Create a TMR-protected integer
protected_value = StandardTMR(42)

# Use the protected value
print(f"Protected value: {protected_value.value}")

# Check integrity
if protected_value.check_integrity():
    print("Value integrity verified")

# Simulate a radiation effect
# In production code, this would happen naturally in radiation environments
# This is just for demonstration purposes
protected_value._v1 = 43  # Corrupt one copy

# Check integrity again
if not protected_value.check_integrity():
    print("Corruption detected!")

    # Attempt to correct the error
    if protected_value.correct():
        print(f"Error corrected, value restored to {protected_value.value}")

# Shutdown the framework
rad_ml.shutdown()
```

### Advanced TMR Demonstration

For a comprehensive demonstration of TMR protection against radiation effects:

```python
import rad_ml_minimal
from rad_ml_minimal.rad_ml.tmr import EnhancedTMR
import random

# Initialize
rad_ml_minimal.initialize()

# Create TMR-protected values of different types
protected_int = EnhancedTMR(100)
protected_float = EnhancedTMR(3.14159)

# Simulate radiation-induced bit flips on these values
def simulate_bit_flip(value, bit_position):
    """Flip a specific bit in the binary representation of a value"""
    if isinstance(value, int):
        return value ^ (1 << bit_position)
    elif isinstance(value, float):
        import struct
        ieee = struct.pack('>f', value)
        i = struct.unpack('>I', ieee)[0]
        i ^= (1 << bit_position)
        return struct.unpack('>f', struct.pack('>I', i))[0]

# Test error correction capabilities
print("Testing TMR protection...")

# Protect data operations in radiation environments
for _ in range(10):
    # Your data operations here
    result = protected_int.value * 2

    # Simulate random radiation effects
    if random.random() < 0.3:  # 30% chance of radiation effect
        bit = random.randint(0, 31)
        corrupted_value = simulate_bit_flip(protected_int.value, bit)
        # In a real scenario, radiation would directly affect memory
        # This is just for demonstration
        protected_int._v2 = corrupted_value

        print(f"Radiation effect simulated, bit {bit} flipped")

        # Verify integrity and correct if needed
        if not protected_int.check_integrity():
            print("Corruption detected!")
            if protected_int.correct():
                print("Error successfully corrected")
            else:
                print("Error correction failed")

# Shutdown
rad_ml_minimal.shutdown()
```

### Using Python with C++ Integration Points

For projects using both Python and C++:

```python
import rad_ml_minimal as rad_ml

# Initialize with specific environment settings
rad_ml.initialize(radiation_environment=rad_ml.RadiationEnvironment.MARS)

# Create protected data structures
# ... your code here ...

# At the language boundary (Python to C++), use the serialization utilities
# to maintain protection across the boundary
serialized_data = rad_ml.serialize_protected_data(your_protected_data)

# Pass serialized_data to C++ components
# ...

# Then in C++:
// auto protected_data = rad_ml::deserialize_protected_data(serialized_data);
// Use protected data in C++ with full radiation protection...

# Finally, shutdown properly
rad_ml.shutdown()
```

## Performance and Resource Utilization

The framework's protection mechanisms come with computational overhead that varies based on the protection level:

| Protection Level    | Computational Overhead | Memory Overhead | Radiation Tolerance | Error Correction |
|---------------------|------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| None                | 0%                     | 0%              | Low                 | 0%               |
| Minimal             | ~25%                   | ~25%            | Low-Medium          | ~30%             |
| Moderate            | ~50%                   | ~50%            | Medium              | ~70%             |
| High                | ~100%                  | ~100%           | High                | ~90%             |
| Very High           | ~200%                  | ~200%           | Very High           | ~95%             |
| Adaptive            | ~75%                   | ~75%            | Environment-Based   | ~85%             |
| Reed-Solomon (12,8) | ~50%                   | ~50%            | High                | ~96%             |
| Gradient Mismatch Protection | 100% prevention | 0% | <0.1% | High |

These metrics represent performance across various radiation environments as validated by Monte Carlo testing. The Adaptive protection strategy dynamically balances overhead and protection based on the current radiation environment, optimizing for both performance and reliability.

## Neural Network Fine-Tuning Results

Recent breakthroughs in our Monte Carlo testing with neural network fine-tuning have yielded surprising and significant findings that challenge conventional wisdom about radiation protection:

### Key Findings

Extensive Monte Carlo simulations (3240 configurations) revealed that:

1. **Architecture Over Protection**: Wider neural network architectures (32-16 nodes) demonstrated superior radiation tolerance compared to standard architectures with explicit protection mechanisms.

2. **Counterintuitive Performance**: The best-performing configuration actually achieved **146.84% accuracy preservation** in a Mars radiation environment - meaning it performed *better* under radiation than in normal conditions. This is something I determined that was due to noise, I did another test in the same radiation environment on Mars to further investigate and I still got counterintuitive performance due to the nature of how the algorithm was functioning within the radiation environments set for Mars within the simulation.

3. **Optimal Configuration**:
   - **Architecture**: Wide (32-16) neural network
   - **Radiation Environment**: Mars
   - **Protection Level**: None (0% memory overhead)
   - **Training Parameters**: 500 epochs, near-zero learning rate, 0.5 dropout rate

4. **Training Factors Matter**: Networks trained with high dropout rates (0.5) demonstrated significantly enhanced radiation tolerance, likely due to the inherent redundancy introduced during training. Further testing revealed that pre-trained networks consistently showed improved radiation tolerance across multiple test scenarios.

### Implications

There is hope for AI in space, these findings can help people develop an AI that can reliably communicate with people in real time when needed to without having to worry about memory loss issues due to radiation effects. AI can not autonomously operate in LEO observing out earth as well as climate change. The cost now to make and design hardware like this will have to change:

1. **Natural Tolerance**: Some neural network architectures appear to possess inherent radiation tolerance without requiring explicit protection mechanisms.

2. **Performance Enhancement**: In certain configurations, radiation effects may actually *enhance* classification performance, suggesting new approaches to network design.

3. **Resource Efficiency**: Zero-overhead protection strategies through architecture and training optimization can replace computationally expensive protection mechanisms.

4. **Mission-Specific Optimization**: Different environments (Mars, GEO, Solar Probe) benefit from different architectural approaches, allowing for mission-specific neural network designs.

All results are available in `optimized_fine_tuning_results.csv` for further analysis. These findings have been incorporated into our fine-tuning framework components to automatically optimize neural networks for specific radiation environments.

## Key Scientific Advancements

The framework introduces several novel scientific and technical advancements:

1. **Physics-Driven Protection Model**: Unlike traditional static protection systems, our framework implements a dynamic model that translates environmental physics into computational protection:
   - Maps trapped particle flux (protons/electrons) to bit-flip probability using empirically-derived transfer functions
   - Applies temperature correction factors (0.73-1.16 observed in testing) to account for thermal effects on semiconductor vulnerability
   - Implements synergy factor modeling for combined radiation/temperature effects
   - Achieved accurate error rate prediction from 10â»â¶ to 10â»Â¹ across 8 radiation environments

2. **Quantum Field Theory Integration**: Our framework incorporates quantum field theory to enhance radiation effect modeling at quantum scales:
   - Implements quantum tunneling calculations for improved defect mobility predictions
   - Applies Klein-Gordon equation solutions for more accurate defect propagation modeling
   - Accounts for zero-point energy contributions at low temperatures
   - Enhances prediction accuracy by up to 22% in extreme conditions (4.2K, 5nm)
   - Automatically applies quantum corrections only when appropriate thresholds are met
   - Shows significant accuracy improvements in nanoscale devices (<20nm) and cryogenic environments (<150K)

3. **Multi-Scale Temporal Protection**: Implements protection at multiple timescales simultaneously:
   - Microsecond scale: Individual computation protection (TMR voting)
   - Second scale: Layer-level validation with Stuck-Bit detection
   - Minute scale: Mission phase adaptation via protection level changes
   - Hour scale: System health monitoring with degradation tracking
   - Day scale: Long-term trend adaptation for extended missions
   - Demonstrated 30Ã dynamic range in checkpoint interval adaptation (10s-302s)

4. **Adaptive Resource Allocation Algorithm**: Dynamically allocates computational protection resources:
   - Sensitivity-based allocation prioritizes critical neural network layers
   - Layer-specific protection levels adjust based on observed error patterns
   - Resource utilization scales with radiation intensity (25%-200% overhead)
   - Maintained 98.5%-100% accuracy from LEO (10â· particles/cmÂ²/s) to Solar Probe missions (10Â¹Â² particles/cmÂ²/s)

5. **Health-Weighted Voting System**: Novel voting mechanism that:
   - Tracks reliability history of each redundant component
   - Applies weighted voting based on observed error patterns
   - Outperformed traditional TMR by 2.3Ã in high-radiation environments
   - Demonstrated 9.1Ã SEU mitigation ratio compared to unprotected computation

6. **Reed-Solomon with Optimized Symbol Size**: Innovative implementation of Reed-Solomon codes:
   - 4-bit symbol representation optimized for neural network quantization
   - Achieved 96.40% error correction with only 50% memory overhead
   - Outperformed traditional 8-bit symbol implementations for space-grade neural networks
   - Demonstrated ability to recover from both random and burst errors

### Robust Error Recovery Under Radiation

Recent testing with gradient size mismatch protection demonstrates a significant breakthrough in radiation-tolerant machine learning:

- **Resilient Neural Network Training**: Framework maintains training stability even when 30% of samples experience radiation-induced memory errors
- **Minimal Accuracy Impact**: Testing shows the ability to converge to optimal accuracy despite frequent gradient corruption
- **Error-Tolerant Architecture**: Skipping corrupted samples proves more effective than attempting to correct or resize corrupted data
- **Resource Optimization**: Protection approach requires no additional memory overhead unlike traditional redundancy techniques

This finding challenges the conventional approach of always attempting to correct errors, showing that for neural networks, intelligently discarding corrupted data can be more effective and resource-efficient than complex error correction schemes.

These advancements collectively represent a significant step forward in radiation-tolerant computing for space applications, enabling ML systems to operate reliably across the full spectrum of space radiation environments.

## Framework Architecture

### Overall Design

Space-Radiation-Tolerant follows a layered architecture designed to provide radiation protection at multiple levels:

1. **Memory Layer**: The foundation that ensures data integrity through protected memory regions and continuous scrubbing.
2. **Redundancy Layer**: Implements various TMR strategies to protect computation through redundant execution and voting.
3. **Error Correction Layer**: Provides advanced Reed-Solomon ECC capabilities for recovering from complex error patterns.
4. **Adaptive Layer**: Dynamically adjusts protection strategies based on environment and criticality.
5. **Application Layer**: Provides radiation-hardened ML components that leverage the protection layers.

This multi-layered approach allows for defense-in-depth, where each layer provides protection against different radiation effects.

### Memory Management Approach

The framework's memory protection integrates both redundancy-based approaches and Reed-Solomon error correction:

- Critical neural network weights and parameters are protected with appropriate levels of redundancy
- Reed-Solomon ECC provides robust protection for larger data structures with minimal overhead
- Memory regions can be selectively protected based on criticality analysis
- The Adaptive protection system dynamically adjusts memory protection based on:
  - Current radiation environment
  - Observed error patterns
  - Resource constraints
  - Criticality of data structures
- For maximum reliability, critical memory can be protected with both redundancy and Reed-Solomon coding

### Radiation Protection Mechanisms

The protection levels implemented in the framework correspond to different protection mechanisms:

1. **MINIMAL Protection (25% overhead)**: Implements basic TMR with simple majority voting:
   ```
   [Copy A] [Copy B] â Simple Voting â Corrected Value
   ```

2. **MODERATE Protection (50% overhead)**: Enhanced protection with checksums:
   ```
   [Copy A + CRC] [Copy B + CRC] â CRC Verification â Voter â Corrected Value
   ```

3. **HIGH Protection (100% overhead)**: Comprehensive TMR with bit-level analysis:
   ```
   [Copy A] [Copy B] [Copy C] â Bit-level Analysis â Voter â Corrected Value
   ```

4. **VERY_HIGH Protection (200% overhead)**: Extensive redundancy with health tracking:
   ```
   [Copy A+CRC] [Copy B+CRC] [Copy C+CRC] [Copy D+CRC] â Health-weighted Voter â Corrected Value
   ```

5. **ADAPTIVE Protection (75% average overhead)**: Dynamic protection that adjusts based on environment:
   ```
   [Environment Analysis] â [Protection Level Selection] â [Appropriate Protection Mechanism]
   ```

6. **Reed-Solomon (12,8) (50% overhead)**: Error correction coding for efficient recovery:
   ```
   [Data Block] â [RS Encoder] â [Protected Block with 4 ECC symbols] â [RS Decoder] â [Recovered Data]
   ```

### Physics-Based Error Modeling

The framework's error modeling system is based on empirical data from Monte Carlo testing across radiation environments:

1. **Environment Error Rates**: Validated error rates derived from testing:
   - LEO: 10^-6 errors/bit
   - MEO: 5Ã10^-6 errors/bit
   - GEO: 10^-5 errors/bit
   - Lunar: 2Ã10^-5 errors/bit
   - Mars: 5Ã10^-5 errors/bit
   - Solar Probe: 10^-4 errors/bit

2. **Error Pattern Distribution**:
   - 78% Single bit errors
   - 15% Adjacent bit errors
   - 7% Multi-bit errors

3. **Temperature Sensitivity**:
   Based on empirical testing, error rates increase approximately 8% per 10Â°C increase in operational temperature above baseline.

4. **Quantum Field Effects**:
   - Quantum tunneling becomes significant below 150K, affecting defect mobility
   - Feature sizes below 20nm show enhanced quantum field effects
   - Extreme conditions (4.2K, 5nm) demonstrate up to 22.14% improvement with quantum corrections
   - Interstitial defects show 1.5Ã greater quantum enhancement than vacancies

These models are used to simulate realistic radiation environments for framework validation and to dynamically adjust protection strategies.

When radiation events occur, the framework follows this validated workflow:

1. **Detection**: Error is detected through checksums, redundancy disagreement, or Reed-Solomon syndrome
2. **Classification**: Error is categorized by type (single-bit, adjacent-bit, or multi-bit) and location
3. **Correction**:
   - For redundancy-protected data: Voting mechanisms attempt correction
   - For RS-protected data: Galois Field arithmetic enables error recovery
   - For hybrid-protected data: Both mechanisms are applied in sequence
4. **Reporting**: Error statistics are tracked and used to adapt protection levels
5. **Adaptation**: Protection strategy may be adjusted based on observed error patterns

### Mission Environment Adaptation

The framework can adapt its protection level based on the radiation environment:

1. In low-radiation environments (LEO), it may use lighter protection for efficiency
2. When entering high-radiation zones (Van Allen Belts), protection is automatically strengthened
3. During solar events, maximum protection is applied to critical components

## Self-Monitoring Radiation Detection

A key innovation in v0.9.6 is the framework's ability to function as its own radiation detector by monitoring internal error statistics, eliminating the need for dedicated radiation sensors in many mission profiles.

### How It Works

The framework continuously monitors:
- Error detection rates across protected memory regions
- Correction success/failure patterns
- Spatial and temporal distribution of bit flips

This data is processed to infer real-time radiation levels, enabling:
1. Dynamic protection adjustment without external sensors
2. Significant reduction in hardware requirements (mass/volume)
3. More efficient resource allocation during mission phases

```cpp
// Example: Using internal error statistics for radiation inference
auto mission_stats = simulator.getErrorStatistics();

// Check if radiation environment has changed based on internal metrics
if (mission_stats.error_rate > threshold) {
    // Dynamically increase protection without external sensors
    protection.setProtectionLevel(neural::ProtectionLevel::HIGH);
    memory_controller.enableIntensiveScrubbing();
}
```

### Advantages Over External Sensors

- **Mass/Volume Reduction**: Eliminates dedicated sensor hardware
- **Power Efficiency**: No additional power required for sensing
- **Integration Simplicity**: Works with existing computing hardware
- **Cost Effectiveness**: Reduces component count and integration complexity
- **Reliability**: No single point of failure in radiation detection

This capability is particularly valuable for small satellites, CubeSats, and deep space missions where resource constraints are significant.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Errors

- **CMake Error with pybind11**: If you encounter an error about pybind11's minimum CMake version being no longer supported:
  ```
  CMake Error at _deps/pybind11-src/CMakeLists.txt:8 (cmake_minimum_required):
    cmake_minimum_required VERSION "3.4" is no longer supported by CMake.
  ```
  Apply the included patch by running:
  ```bash
  ./apply-patches.sh
  ```
  This patch updates pybind11's minimum required CMake version from 3.4 to 3.5 for compatibility with modern CMake versions.

- **Eigen3 Not Found**: If you encounter Eigen3-related build errors, you can install it using:
  ```bash
  # Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev

  # macOS
  brew install eigen

  # Windows (with vcpkg)
  vcpkg install eigen3
  ```
  Alternatively, the framework will use its minimal stub implementation.

- **Boost Not Found**: If Boost libraries are not found, install them:
```bash
  # Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

  # macOS
  brew install boost

  # Windows (with vcpkg)
  vcpkg install boost
  ```

#### Runtime Issues

- **Unexpected Protection Behavior**: Verify your mission environment configuration. Protection levels adapt to the environment, so an incorrect environment configuration can lead to unexpected protection behavior.

- **High CPU Usage**: The TMR implementations, especially Hybrid Redundancy, are computationally intensive by design. Consider using a lower protection level for testing or development environments.

- **Checkpoint Interval Too Short**: For extreme radiation environments, the framework may reduce checkpoint intervals to very small values (e.g., 10s). This is expected behavior in high-radiation scenarios.

### Debugging

The framework includes various debugging tools:

- Set the environment variable `RAD_ML_LOG_LEVEL` to control log verbosity:
```bash
  export RAD_ML_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG  # Options: ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE
  ```

- Enable detailed diagnostics with:
```bash
  export RAD_ML_DIAGNOSTICS=1
  ```

- Simulate specific radiation events with the test tools:
```bash
  ./build/radiation_event_simulator --environment=LEO --event=SEU
  ```

### Framework Design Notes

#### Type-Safe Environment Specification

The framework uses enum classes for type safety rather than strings:

```cpp
// In mission_environment.hpp
namespace rad_ml::sim {

enum class Environment {
    LEO,           // Low Earth Orbit
    MEO,           // Medium Earth Orbit
    GEO,           // Geostationary Orbit
    LUNAR,         // Lunar vicinity
    MARS,          // Mars vicinity
    SOLAR_PROBE,   // Solar probe mission
    SAA            // South Atlantic Anomaly region
};

enum class MissionPhase {
    LAUNCH,
    CRUISE,
    ORBIT_INSERTION,
    SCIENCE_OPERATIONS,
    SAA_CROSSING,
    SOLAR_STORM,
    SAFE_MODE
};

RadiationEnvironment createEnvironment(Environment env);

} // namespace rad_ml::sim
```

Using enum classes instead of strings provides:
- Compile-time type checking
- IDE autocompletion
- Protection against typos or invalid inputs
- Better code documentation

2. **Protection Strategy Optimization**: Balance protection overhead against radiation tolerance requirements
3. **Neural Network Resilience Testing**: Identify architectural weaknesses and optimize for radiation tolerance
4. **Failure Mode Analysis**: Understand how radiation affects system components and develop mitigations

These enhancements significantly improve the framework's value for space mission planning and ML system design for radiation environments.

## Memory Safety Best Practices (v0.9.6)

The framework now includes several best practices for developing radiation-tolerant software with robust memory safety:

### Key Memory Safety Principles

1. **Use tryGet() Instead of Direct Access**
   ```cpp
   // Preferred approach
   auto value = tmr_protected_value.tryGet();
   if (value) {
       // Process *value safely
   }

   // Avoid direct access which may throw exceptions
   // NOT recommended: float x = tmr_protected_value.get();
   ```

2. **Protect Mutex Operations**
   ```cpp
   // Wrap mutex operations in try-catch blocks
   try {
       std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(data_mutex);
       // Critical section
   } catch (const std::exception& e) {
       // Handle mutex corruption
       fallback_operation();
   }
   ```

3. **Proper Memory Registration**
   ```cpp
   // Use static storage for memory regions
   static std::array<float, SIZE> weight_buffer;

   // Copy critical data to protected storage
   std::copy(weights.begin(), weights.end(), weight_buffer.begin());

   // Register the static buffer
   simulator.registerMemoryRegion(weight_buffer.data(),
                               weight_buffer.size() * sizeof(float),
                               true);
   ```

4. **Graceful Degradation**
   ```cpp
   // Process all elements with error handling
   size_t valid_elements = 0;
   for (size_t i = 0; i < weights.size(); i++) {
       try {
           if (weights[i]) {
               result += process(weights[i]);
               valid_elements++;
           }
       } catch (...) {
           // Skip corrupted elements
       }
   }

   // Scale result based on valid elements processed
   if (valid_elements > 0) {
       result /= valid_elements;
   }
   ```

5. **Global Exception Handling**
   ```cpp
   int main() {
       try {
           // Main application code
       } catch (const std::exception& e) {
           // Log the error
           std::cerr << "Fatal error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
           // Perform safe shutdown
           return 1;
       } catch (...) {
           // Handle unknown errors
           std::cerr << "Unknown fatal error" << std::endl;
           return 1;
       }
   }
   ```

These best practices are derived from extensive testing in simulated radiation environments and provide significant improvements in system reliability for critical space applications.

# Reed-Solomon Monte Carlo Testing

This project implements and tests Reed-Solomon error correction codes for protecting neural network weights in radiation environments using Monte Carlo simulation.

## Overview

The Monte Carlo testing script performs thousands of randomized trials to evaluate Reed-Solomon's effectiveness in correcting bit errors across a range of error rates. This provides statistically robust results with confidence intervals.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- tqdm

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tqdm
```

## Running the Tests

Run the Monte Carlo simulation with the default settings:
```bash
python rs_monte_carlo.py
```

Or customize the simulation parameters:
```bash
python rs_monte_carlo.py --trials 5000 --min-rate 0.0005 --max-rate 0.25 --num-rates 30
```

### Command Line Arguments

- `--trials`: Number of trials per error rate (default: 1000)
- `--min-rate`: Minimum bit error rate as decimal (default: 0.001)
- `--max-rate`: Maximum bit error rate as decimal (default: 0.3)
- `--num-rates`: Number of error rates to test (default: 20)
- `--output`: Output file for plot image (default: rs_monte_carlo_results.png)
- `--csv`: Output file for CSV data (default: rs_monte_carlo_results.csv)

## Interpreting Results

The script generates:

1. **Plot with two graphs**:
   - Top graph: Success rate vs. bit error rate with 95% confidence intervals
   - Bottom graph: Average bit errors and corrected errors vs. bit error rate

2. **CSV file** with detailed results for each error rate

3. **Console output** with a summary of key results and the error correction threshold (where success rate drops below 50%)

### Key Metrics

- **Success Rate**: Percentage of trials where the error correction fully recovered the original value
- **Confidence Intervals**: Statistical range showing the reliability of the success rate
- **Average Bit Errors**: Mean number of bit errors introduced at each error rate
- **Average Corrected Errors**: Mean number of bit errors successfully corrected

## Implementation Details

The implementation includes:
- Galois Field (GF(2^8)) arithmetic
- Reed-Solomon encoder/decoder with 8 ECC symbols
- Random bit error simulation
- Statistical analysis with confidence intervals

This RS8Bit8Sym implementation can theoretically correct up to 4 symbol errors.
