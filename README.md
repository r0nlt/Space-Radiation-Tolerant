## Framework Architecture

### Overall Design

The rad-tolerant-ml framework follows a layered architecture designed to provide radiation protection at multiple levels:

1. **Memory Layer**: The foundation that ensures data integrity through protected memory regions and continuous scrubbing.
2. **Redundancy Layer**: Implements various TMR strategies to protect computation through redundant execution and voting.
3. **Error Management Layer**: Detects, categorizes, and handles errors with appropriate severity handling.
4. **Application Layer**: Provides radiation-hardened ML components that leverage the protection layers.

This multi-layered approach allows for defense-in-depth, where each layer provides protection against different radiation effects.

### Memory Management Approach

The framework uses a managed dynamic memory allocation approach through the `UnifiedMemoryManager` singleton:

- All memory allocations are tracked and can be protected with various mechanisms
- Memory regions are automatically registered for background scrubbing
- Rather than avoiding dynamic allocation entirely, we make it radiation-tolerant
- Memory integrity is verified through checksums, canary values, or TMR depending on protection level
- Allocations are monitored for leaks, corruption, and usage patterns

### Radiation Protection Mechanisms

The core TMR implementations work as follows:

1. **Basic TMR**: Maintains three copies of data and uses majority voting to correct errors:
   ```
   [Copy A] [Copy B] [Copy C] → Voter → Corrected Value
   ```

2. **Enhanced TMR**: Adds CRC checksums and health tracking to improve error detection:
   ```
   [Copy A + CRC] [Copy B + CRC] [Copy C + CRC] → CRC Verification → Health-aware Voter → Corrected Value
   ```

3. **Stuck-Bit TMR**: Specializes in detecting and correcting stuck bits (a common radiation effect):
   ```
   [Copy A] [Copy B] [Copy C] → Bit-level Analysis → Stuck Bit Detection → Bit-aware Voter → Corrected Value
   ```

4. **Hybrid Redundancy**: Combines spatial (multiple copies) and temporal (multiple computations) redundancy:
   ```
   [Time 1: Copies A,B,C] + [Time 2: Copies A,B,C] → Spatio-temporal Voter → Corrected Value
   ```

### Error Detection and Recovery Flow

When radiation events occur, the framework follows this general flow:

1. **Detection**: Error is detected through CRC mismatch, TMR disagreement, or memory scrubbing
2. **Classification**: Error is categorized by type (SEU, MBU, etc.) and severity
3. **Correction**: 
   - For TMR-protected data: Majority voting attempts correction
   - For memory regions: Memory scrubber performs repair operations
   - For uncorrectable errors: Graceful degradation with error reporting
4. **Reporting**: Detailed error information is logged for analysis
5. **Recovery**: System state is restored when possible or operation continues with degraded capability

### Mission Environment Adaptation

The framework can adapt its protection level based on the radiation environment:

1. In low-radiation environments (LEO), it may use lighter protection for efficiency
2. When entering high-radiation zones (Van Allen Belts), protection is automatically strengthened
3. During solar events, maximum protection is applied to critical components

## Getting Started

- CMake 3.15 or higher

### Building

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Running Tests

```bash
make test
```

### Running the NASA/ESA Standard Verification Test

To perform comprehensive verification of the framework against NASA/ESA radiation testing standards:

```bash
./run_nasa_esa_test.sh
```

This verification process:
- Validates the framework against standards like NASA-HDBK-4002A, ECSS-E-ST-10-12C, and JEDEC JESD57
- Performs extensive Monte Carlo simulations (25,000+ trials by default)
- Conducts statistical validation with chi-square and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests
- Generates comprehensive HTML and CSV reports with detailed metrics
- Produces a formal verification statement with go/no-go mission suitability assessments

The test verifies and reports on:
- Environment model integration with CREME96
- Implementation of critical metrics (SEU rate, LET threshold, cross-section, BER, MTBF)
- Evaluation of protection techniques (TMR, EDAC, scrubbing) with effectiveness ratios
- Radiation hardening assessment for all supported mission environments
- Detailed performance analysis and resource overhead measurements

### Running the Standard Industry Validation Test

To validate the framework against NASA and ESA radiation models:

```bash
./industry_standard_test
```

This will produce a detailed HTML report with accuracy metrics, protection efficiency, and compliance with industry standards.

### Running the Mission Simulator

The mission simulator demonstrates the adaptive radiation protection system and physics-based radiation simulation:

```bash
