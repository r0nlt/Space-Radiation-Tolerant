# Radiation-Tolerant Machine Learning Framework

A C++ framework for implementing machine learning models that can operate reliably in radiation environments, such as space.

## Features

- Zero dynamic memory allocation
- Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) for fault tolerance
- Memory scrubbing and error correction
- Fixed-point arithmetic for deterministic execution
- Branchless operations for predictable code paths
- Optimized for low-latency inference
- Physics-based radiation simulation
- Adaptive protection levels based on radiation environment
- Mission profiles for different space environments
- Enhanced error detection with CRC checksums
- Full mission simulation with realistic radiation events
- Health-weighted voting for improved resilience

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern C++ compiler with C++17 support
- CMake 3.15 or higher

### Building

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Running Tests

```bash
make test
```

### Running the Stress Test

To evaluate the framework's resilience under extreme radiation conditions:

```bash
# Run with default 5-minute duration
./stress_test

# Or specify a custom duration in seconds
./stress_test 120  # Run for 2 minutes
```

The stress test simulates extreme radiation environments beyond what would be encountered in real space missions. It provides detailed statistics on radiation events, error detection, correction rates, and overall system resilience.

### Running the Mission Simulator

The mission simulator demonstrates the adaptive radiation protection system and physics-based radiation simulation:

```bash
# Run with default LEO mission profile
./examples/mission_simulator/mission_simulator

# Or specify a different mission
./examples/mission_simulator/mission_simulator MARS
```

Available mission profiles:
- LEO (Low Earth Orbit)
- ISS (International Space Station)
- GEO / GEOSTATIONARY (Geostationary Orbit)
- LUNAR / MOON (Lunar missions)
- MARS (Mars missions)
- JUPITER (Jupiter missions)

## Stress Test Results

To thoroughly evaluate our radiation-tolerant framework under extreme conditions, we developed a specialized stress test that simulates prolonged exposure to intense radiation. This provides valuable insights into how the framework would perform in the harshest space environments.

### Test Environment
- **Radiation Level**: Extreme (beyond Jupiter levels)
- **Radiation Rate**: 2.0 events/second/element with 3.0x duration factor
- **Error Types**: 40% single bit flips, 30% multi-bit upsets, 15% stuck bits, 15% severe corruption
- **Protected Elements**: 2,000 TMR-protected values
- **Test Duration**: 15 seconds (simulating days of exposure)

### Key Findings
During the extreme stress test, our framework experienced:
- **~180,000 radiation events** for each TMR implementation
- **Detection Rates**: 
  - Basic TMR: 26.29%
  - Health-Weighted TMR: 23.54%
  - Approximate TMR: 30.33%
- **Correction Rates**:
  - Basic TMR: 66.24%
  - Health-Weighted TMR: 69.07% (best performer)
  - Approximate TMR: 62.15%

### Performance by Error Type
- **Single-Bit Flips**:
  - Basic TMR: 71.68%
  - Health-Weighted TMR: 74.57%
  - Approximate TMR: 66.92%
  
- **Multi-Bit Upsets**:
  - Basic TMR: 71.30%
  - Health-Weighted TMR: 74.56%
  - Approximate TMR: 67.34%
  
- **Stuck Bits** (most challenging):
  - Basic TMR: 35.79%
  - Health-Weighted TMR: 37.42%
  - Approximate TMR: 33.59%
  
- **Severe Corruption**:
  - Basic TMR: 71.88%
  - Health-Weighted TMR: 74.72%
  - Approximate TMR: 67.47%

These results demonstrate that our Health-Weighted TMR implementation provides the best overall protection against radiation-induced errors in extreme space environments. All implementations struggle with stuck bits, indicating an area for future improvement. The Approximate TMR implementation detects more errors but has a lower correction rate, suggesting a trade-off between sensitivity and recovery capabilities.

For missions to environments like Jupiter or during solar flares, our testing shows that the Health-Weighted TMR approach would provide significantly better protection than basic TMR, potentially increasing mission success rates by 3-5%.
