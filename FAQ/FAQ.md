# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## What is the rad_ml Framework?

The `rad_ml` framework is an open-source toolkit for developing, simulating, and validating **radiation-tolerant machine learning and embedded systems**. It provides tools for error injection, adaptive protection, checkpointing, and mission simulationâ€”enabling robust AI and software for space, avionics, and other radiation-prone environments.

## How is this different from GEANT4?

- **GEANT4** is a comprehensive, physics-accurate particle transport toolkit used for simulating the passage of particles through matter (e.g., in high-energy physics, medical physics, and shielding design).
- **Space-Radiation-Tolerant** focuses on the *system and ML level*: simulating the effects of radiation on neural networks, embedded systems, and mission-critical software, with fast, abstracted models suitable for rapid prototyping and research.
- If you need detailed, physics-level simulation, use GEANT4. If you want to study ML robustness, error mitigation, or system-level effects, use rad_ml.

## What hardware is this for?

- Designed for **space-grade, avionics, and mission-critical hardware** (e.g., FPGAs, microcontrollers, radiation-hardened processors).
- Also useful for research on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware in harsh environments.

## How do I use the framework?

1. **Install dependencies** (see [README.md](README.md)).
2. **Explore the [Documentation Index](README.md#documentation-index)** for module overviews and usage guides.
3. Use provided examples in the `examples/` directory to get started with:
   - Radiation-aware neural network training
   - Mission simulation
   - Error injection and recovery
4. Integrate with your own ML models or embedded systems as needed.

## What are the limitations?

- Not a replacement for full physics simulation.
- Focuses on system-level and ML-level effects, not detailed material/geometry modeling.
- Some features are experimental; see [Research Module](include/rad_ml/research/RESEARCH.md) for advanced capabilities.
