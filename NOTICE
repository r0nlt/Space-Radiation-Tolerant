The Space-Radiation-Tolerant Machine Learning Framework is a comprehensive solution for
implementing fault-tolerant neural networks and machine learning models capable
of operating reliably in high-radiation environments such as space. This work
includes novel methods for Health-Weighted Triple Modular Redundancy,
Approximate TMR, Selective Hardening, and physics-based radiation simulation.

This work represents significant intellectual contribution to the field of
radiation-tolerant computing and is provided under the AGPL v3 license with the
