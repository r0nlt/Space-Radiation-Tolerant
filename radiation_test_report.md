### 14.4 Key Findings

1. **Protection Effectiveness Scale**: The more severe the radiation environment, the greater the benefit of protection mechanisms. At the highest error rate (Jupiter-like conditions), Advanced TMR provides a 36.40% improvement in accuracy.

2. **Environment Impact**: Without protection, model accuracy degrades from 100% to 58.80% as error rates increase from 0% to 50%, demonstrating the critical need for radiation hardening.

3. **Protection Level Comparison**: 
   - Basic TMR provides significant improvements across all environments
   - Enhanced TMR (5 voters) shows increasing benefits in more severe environments
   - Advanced TMR (7 voters) provides the best protection, especially at higher error rates

4. **Operational Recommendations**:
   - For LEO applications, Basic TMR provides sufficient protection (+0.70%)
   - For GEO/Lunar missions, Enhanced TMR provides a good balance of protection and efficiency
   - For Mars and beyond, Advanced TMR is essential, providing up to 36.40% improvement in extreme conditions
   - In minimal-radiation environments, protection can be disabled to save computing resources

5. **Resource-Accuracy Tradeoff**: The framework's dynamic protection allows balancing computational overhead against model accuracy based on the environment severity. This intelligent adaptation optimizes the "protection per compute cycle" efficiency.
