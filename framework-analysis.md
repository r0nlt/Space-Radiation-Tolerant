## 7. Conclusion

The rad-tolerant-ml framework demonstrates strong model alignment with NASA/ESA radiation standards (100% NASA, 98.91% ESA correlation) and excellent protection in simulated LEO environments (99.42% accuracy with Stuck-Bit TMR). However, there is a critical gap between theoretical performance and practical mission suitability, with current implementations deemed not suitable for actual mission deployment.

The framework's strengths lie in its well-architected memory management system, type-safe TMR implementations, and comprehensive validation framework. Its primary limitations include insufficient protection in extreme radiation environments, high resource overhead, and the need for more rigorous real-world validation.

While the accuracy metrics show significant technical achievement, especially the 99.42% accuracy in LEO environments and 88.53% in interplanetary space, the framework must overcome the "not suitable" classification for space missions. This will require focused improvements in radiation hardening techniques, power efficiency, and reliability across all operational environments.

Future development should prioritize advancing the Stuck-Bit TMR implementation and introducing new protection mechanisms specifically designed for extreme radiation scenarios, while maintaining the excellent model correlation already achieved.
